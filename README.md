# Pendulum ni Bathala  

## Project Aims  

**Pendulum ni Bathala** (Bathala’s Pendulum) is an electromagnetic pendulum designed to swing indefinitely using electromagnetic pulses until the lithium ion battery is drained. By gluing together principles of **electromagnetism**, this project demonstrates how energy can be transferred efficiently to keep the pendulum in constant motion without any manual force.  

This project serves as both an **educational tool** for understanding electromagnetism (primarily Faraday's 1s t Law) and a **practical demonstration** of how electromagnetic forces can sustain motion with minimal energy loss.  

## How It Works  

The system consists of the following components:  

- **Pendulum bob (Neodymium Round Countersunk Magnet)** – A magnet that swings back and forth.  
- **Copper coils (2x)** – One is for detecting changes in magnetic flux, and the other one is for generating electromagnetic pulses. 
- **Transistor (NPN)** – Acts as a switch to control the electromagnetic pulses once it receives minimal current from the coil which detects a change in magnetic flux.  
- **Capacitor (100μF electrolytic)**  – Stores and releases energy to regulate the pulse.  
- **Lithium Ion Battery (7.4V - 9V)** – Supplies power to the system.  

### Working Principle  

1. The **pendulum bob swings** over the copper coils.
2. As it passes the coils, the **first coil detects the motion** using electromagnetic induction.  
3. The **transistor is activated**, allowing a pulse of current to flow through the coils.  
4. This alerts the 2nd coil which then **induces a magnetic field**, giving the pendulum a small push.  
5. The **process repeats**, maintaining the swing until the battery is depleted.  

## Applications  

- **Educational Demonstration** – Explains electromagnetism in an interactive way.  
- **Physics Experiment** – Showcases conservation of energy and induction principles.  

## Circuit Diagram  

*(Include a simple schematic of the circuit here.)*  

## Assembly Instructions  

1. Build a suitable frame
2. Attach the **pendulum bob** to a stable pivot point.  
3. Position the **copper coils** directly beneath the pendulum’s path.  
4. Connect the **transistor, capacitor, and battery** as per the circuit diagram.  
5. Ensure the battery is securely in place to supply consistent power.  
6. Test the setup by manually swinging the pendulum and observing its sustained motion.  

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the project, I wish to strenghthen my understanding of these topics:

- Understand more of Faraday's 1st law and Lenz Law
- Experience how to make a physics experiment
- Experience how to do woodworking
