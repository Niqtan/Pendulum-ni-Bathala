## Pendulum ni Bathala

Project Aims
The Pendulum ni Bathala (Bathala's Pendulum's) is an electromagnetic pendulum by making the pendulum swing indefinitely with an electromagnetic pulse until the dry cell has been drained. By gluing together concepts of electromagnetism,

How it works
The system consists of:

- Coil core
	- Mainly used for inducing current in the system. Using faraday's 1st law, by changing the magnetic flux near the coil, then the current will get induced.
- 10-16mm 2-6cm  bolt
	- A pendulum used for 
- Transistor
	- Used for turning on and off the circuit
- Capacitor
	- Used for smoothening the DC 
-
